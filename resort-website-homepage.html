    <h1> See why Austin is the gem of Texas </h1>
    <p> The secret is out. Everyone who visits Austin these days leaves with something great to say. They can't stop talking about our legendary live music, burgeoning restaurant scene, unique culture, vibrant and welcoming community, as well as a list of other things that you just have to experience for yourself to truly understand what makes Austin so Austin. The rest of the country has already taken notice. And it's time you did, too. </p>
